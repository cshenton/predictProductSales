# Predicting Product Sales with XGBoost

This is a straightforward implementation of XGBoost for a regression problem. 

## Data

Data are from the Online Product Sales competition on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/c/online-sales. They are split into TrainingDataset.csv and TestDataset.csv. 

Each row represents a product, with various unlabelled Quantitative and Categorical Features. The training data contain 12 sales variables, one for each month of the product's first year.

## Goal

To train a model on the training data, and make 12 separate sales predictions (one per month) for the products in the test data. 

## Process



## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.
